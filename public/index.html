        <h2>Buying Old Computers</h2>
        <p>While the low prices from some guy on Craigslist may tempt you, who knows what you’re getting. If something goes wrong, can you contact him? It’s buyer beware when purchasing electronics from sources like Craigslist and eBay.</p>
        <p>Many businesses both brick and mortar and online sell refurbished and used computers. They often come with some type of limited warranty.</p>
        <p>A business has a reputation to uphold. Selling bad electronics isn’t good in a world of Yelp and Facebook reviews.</p>
        <p>You can contact businesses because they have a presence either physical or online. If you have problems or have another need to contact them, then it’s easier than if you dealt with an individual.</p>

        <h2>Buying New Computers</h2>
        <p>These days, it’s not unusual for individuals or families to have more than one type of computer. If you’re looking to carry your computer to work or on vacation, you obviously need a laptop. And some have slimmed down to weigh as little as a couple of pounds.</p>
        <p>If mobility isn’t a concern, get a desktop, because it’s very likely that you’ll get more performance for the same money—plus more flexibility in customizing the machine once you buy it. (That’s one reason lots of serious gamers have desktops.)</p>
        <p>Those are two major categories of computer, but there are several variations to consider—and we haven’t even mentioned the choice of operating system yet.</p>
        <p>Choices among computers are becoming more confusing as the boundaries between categories blur. For instance, some new desktops are almost as small and inconspicuous as a laptop. Conversely, you can easily find a laptop that’s just as powerful as a typical desktop. And then there are some slightly unconventional categories, such as laptops that can be used liked tablets and all-in-one desktops that don't need a separate monitor. For more, check our full computer ratings (available to Consumer Reports members).</p>
